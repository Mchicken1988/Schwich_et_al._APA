iCLIP RNAmaps for regulated PAS

Description:

     Create RNAmaps at pPASs and dPASs of transcripts with changes in
     3'UTR length for two iCLIP libraries.

Usage:

     create_RNAmaps_for_regulated_PAS(
       PASs.gr,
       iCLIP1.plus.bw,
       iCLIP1.minus.bw,
       iCLIP2.plus.bw,
       iCLIP2.minus.bw,
       upstream = 450,
       downstream = 150,
       DaPars = c("SRSF3", "SRSF7", "CPSF6", "Diff"),
       UTR3.length = c("shorter", "longer")
     )
     
Arguments:

 PASs.gr: A GRanges object containing exact positions of PASs. Required
          metadata columns are 'PAS.type' as well as
          'new.DaPars.SRSF3.regulation', 'new.DaPars.SRSF7.regulation',
          'new.DaPars.CPSF6.regulation' and
          'new.DaPars.Diff.regulation', which indicate the change in
          3'UTR length of the hosting transcript in the different
          DaPars comparisons.

iCLIP1.plus.bw: Path to the BigWig-File of the plus strand for iCLIP
          library 1.

iCLIP1.minus.bw: Path to the BigWig-File of the minus strand for iCLIP
          library 1.

iCLIP2.plus.bw: Path to the BigWig-File of the plus strand for iCLIP
          library 2.

iCLIP2.minus.bw: Path to the BigWig-File of the minus strand for iCLIP
          library 2.

upstream: Number of upstream nucleotides to include in the RNAmap.

downstream: Number of downstream nucleotides to include in the RNAmap.

  DaPars: The DaPars comparison to look at. Choices are 'SRSF3' (Srsf3
          KD/Ctrl), 'SRSF7' (Srsf7 KD/Ctrl), 'CPSF6' (Cpsf6 KD/Ctrl)
          and 'Diff' (Diff/Undiff).

UTR3.length: The set of transcripts to look at. Choices are 'shorter'
          (3'UTRs are getting shorter in the respective DaPars
          comparison) and 'longer' (3'UTRs are getting longer in the
          respective DaPars comparison).

Details:

     RNAmaps at pPASs and dPASs of transcripts with changes in 3'UTR
     length are generated for two iCLIP libraries in a user-defined
     window. In addition, for each PAS type and iCLIP library binding
     signals at not affected PASs are shown. Significant signal
     differences (adjusted P value <= 0.01) between regulated and not
     regulated PASs are indicated in black beneath the signals.

Value:

     RNAmap plot
