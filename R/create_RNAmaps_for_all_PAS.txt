iCLIP RNAmaps for all PAS

Description:

     Create RNAmaps at sPASs, pPASs and dPASs for two iCLIP libraries.

Usage:

     create_RNAmaps_for_all_PAS(
       PASs.gr,
       iCLIP1.plus.bw,
       iCLIP1.minus.bw,
       iCLIP2.plus.bw,
       iCLIP2.minus.bw,
       upstream = 450,
       downstream = 150
     )
     
Arguments:

 PASs.gr: A GRanges object containing exact positions of PASs as single
          nucleotide region. A metadata column called "PAS.type" is
          required for each region and should be either sPAS, pPAS or
          dPAS.

iCLIP1.plus.bw: Path to the BigWig-File of the plus strand for iCLIP
          library 1.

iCLIP1.minus.bw: Path to the BigWig-File of the minus strand for iCLIP
          library 1.

iCLIP2.plus.bw: Path to the BigWig-File of the plus strand for iCLIP
          library 2.

iCLIP2.minus.bw: Path to the BigWig-File of the minus strand for iCLIP
          library 2.

upstream: Number of upstream nucleotides to include in the RNAmap.

downstream: Number of downstream nucleotides to include in the RNAmap.

Details:

     For each PAS type (i.e. sPAS, pPAS and dPAS) RNAmaps for two iCLIP
     libraries are generated in a user-defined window. For comparison
     of signal differences between the two iCLIP libraries, two
     proportions Z-tests are performed for each position. Positions
     with a significant signal difference (adjusted P value <= 0.01)
     are indicated in black beneath the signals.

Value:

     RNAmap plot
