Here you can find the most important code to our publication "SR proteins SRSF3 and SRSF7 modulate 3â€™UTR length in opposite directions through suppression or activation of proximal polyadenylation sites and regulation of CFIm levels".

*create_RNAmaps_for_all_PASs.R* was used to generate RNAmaps showing the binding signal at all detected sPASs, pPASs and dPASs.
