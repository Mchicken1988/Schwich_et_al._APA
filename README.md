## create_RNAmaps_for_all_PASs.R

This function was used to generate RNAmaps showing binding signal at all detected sPASs, pPASs and dPASs for two iCLIP libraries.

## create_RNAmaps_for_regulated_PASs.R

This function was used to generate RNAmaps showing binding signal at regulated pPASs and dPASs (e.g. from transcripts with shorter 3'UTRs in the *Srsf3* KD) in comparison to pPASs and dPASs of transcripts not affected for two iCLIP libraries.

## motif_search.R

This function was used to search for an enrichment of SRSF3 and SRSF7 consensus binding motifs (e.g. GAY) around sPASs, pPASs and dPASs.
